LESSONS FROM MODELING THUS FAR:
-Models are very sensitive to both input and output variables.  The relationship between rainfall and malnutrition varies greatly depending on whether the variable of interest is HAZ or WHZ, SPI or SPEI, as well as the time scale the index is measured at. This will be hard to deal with and may lead to p-hacking/cherry picking.
-Forest Cover from ESA and from Hansen are quite different, with many areas having nearly 100% forest in Hansen and 0% forest in ESA.  Interestingly, few areas are high on forest in ESA and low in forest on Hansen.
	-Problem: Shitty RS classifications, ambiguous definitions of forest?
	-Overall R2: 0.6
-Forests are associated with worse nutrition outcomes! This effect goes away if you only look at households far from markets.  Also, grass and water seem to help nutrition outcomes.
-Random effects for precip indices do improve the model over fixed effects for precip indices based on AIC.
	-Vindication!
-Random effects are often correlated with HAZ when using LMER.
	-Problem: Overfitting?
	-(I think)? this was less of an issue with Rstan
-Large random effects seem to happen more often with small SPI values, and never happen with large SPI values.
	-Problem: Overfitting?
	-Solution: Try Binning SPI
-Lots of Spatial Autocorrelation in Error terms, especially if you dont include geographic variables or site-level varying intercepts
-Differences in hh and individual-level variables do not matter much, residuals are very similar
	-Use few control variables that permit a wide range of DHS sites
-Running the regression for only part of the SPI spectrum can yield weird coefficients; best to use binning.
-Urban sites in DHS are country determined, any coefficient should be at the country level
-Due to measurement error at each month, use month as a factor


TO DO:
-Systematically test precip indices for correlation with HAZ, for interaction with ES
	-Make Plots
		-Nature vs SPI
		-GAM plots
	-Make Regressions
		-Betas
		-P-Values
		-Distribution of Random Effects
		-interaction betas and p-values
		-difference in betas and p-values after adding ES.
		-Test for correlation with residuals

	-Look at Loess vs Residuals?

-Test ESA product vs Hansen, JRC water, Globeland30
-Track down globeland30 for 1990?
-Try models with Binary ES, SPI variables.
	-This worked well!
-Run complicated model in Rstan using simulated data.
-Learn R-INLA!
-Re-run spatial covars adding builtup, log transform necessary vars (like GDP)
