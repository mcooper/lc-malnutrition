Talk to Stefan:
-What to focus on?  Make the table. I think just ES, the modeling is pretty similar anyway...

-Some other possibilites for modeling: hglm, INLA.  INLA sounds promising bc it can handle spatio temporal data.  I think estimating each sites Random Effect independantly is pretty stupid.  I am open to a st model that is frequentist but so far it looks like Bayesian is the best out there.

-What about just modeling malnutrition and doing something with the residuals.  I am not sure how all of these complex models are estimating random effects.  Maybe just model the residuals and see where they are correlated with the environmental variables?  I.e., where is HAZ better than we would expect, given (diarrhea, income, parents ed), and associated with healthy ecosystems.

-Look at SPEI across child's age


Next Steps:
-Test things in STATA
-Examine Residuals more - normal distribution?  Funny correlations?  Maybe a Moran's I. - residuals dont matter.
-Test fixed vs random effects, compare AIC
-Email: Juraj Balkovich about (? crop calendar?)
-scatterplot HAZ and SPEI, subset by regions.
-Categorize the ES variable, and run different regressions, show how the coef for SPI varies.
-Make an output of random effect at admin area levels.

Possible innovations
-Look at just residuals
-Try a binary parameter

HOW TO SUBMIT A TICKET FOR INTERNET SPEEDS?

I tried the scatterplot.

Maybe try with stan:
Binary outcome, maybe with trichotomized SPI term
GAM-style model for All-in-One
